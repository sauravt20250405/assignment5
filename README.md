This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating basic operations with dictionaries, strings, and lists. The first script (assignment5task1.py) creates a dictionary of student names and their marks, then prompts the user to enter a name and displays the corresponding marks or a “Student not found” message if the name doesn't exist. The second script (assignment5task2.py) demonstrates list slicing by creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracting the first five elements, reversing them, and printing both the original and modified lists. These tasks illustrate fundamental data structure manipulations in Python.
